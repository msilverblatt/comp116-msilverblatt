This is an implementation of a scanner for iOS traffic. It summarizes the traffic it has scanned and displays it on the terminal.
The various options it can be run with can be see by running './iosscan -h'.
I chose this as my project because it allowed to make a legitimately useful tool for network analysis, and it was an opportunity for me to work in python for the first time. There is definitely a ton of functionality I would have liked to build in, such as more interactivity and better filters for determining types of traffic that are being sent. Overall, I am happy with the finished product and can confidently say I have an in depth knowledge of the security concerns and procedures in iOS applications.
