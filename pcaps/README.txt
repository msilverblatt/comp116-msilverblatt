set1.pcap

1. How many packets are there in this set?
276

2. What protocol was used to transfer files from PC to server?
FTP

3. Briefly describe why the protocol used to transfer the files is insecure?
When using FTP all data in packets is sent in a plain-text format, meaning it is visible to anyone who can intercept the packet.

4. What is the secure alternative to the protocol used to transfer files?
SFTP is a secure version of the file transfer protocol that encrypts all data being sent over a network

5. What is the IP address of the server?


6. What was the username and password used to access the server?
username: stokerj
password: w00tfu!

7. How many files were transferred from PC to server?

8. What are the names of the files transferred from PC to server?

9. Extract all the files that were transferred from PC to server. These files must be part of your submission!

set2.pcap

10. How many packets are there in your set?

11. How many plaintext username-password pairs are there in this packet set?

12. Briefly describe how you found the username-password pairs.

13. For each of the plaintext username-password pair that you found, identify the protocol used, server IP, the corresponding domain name (e.g., google.com), and port number.

IMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT LOG ON TO THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USERNAME-PASSWORD THAT YOU FOUND!

14. Of all the plaintext username-password pairs that you found, how many of them are legitimate? That is, the username-password was valid, access successfully granted?

15. How did you verified the successful username-password pairs?

16. In a few words, explain why I asked you not to log on to websites or services associated with the username-password pairs that you found.

17. What advice would you give to the owners of the username-password pairs that you found so their account information would not be revealed "in-the-clear" in the future?

18. Provide a listing of all IP addresses with corresponding hosts (hostname + domain name) that are in this PCAP set. Describe your methodology.

19. Provide a summary of the all protocols used. What was the most popular protocol used? Describe your methodology.

20. A fun question: what other interesting things did you find in this PCAP set (e.g., files)?
